Interest rates have experienced a significant rise in recent years, leading to an unprecedented downturn in the housing market.
Despite house prices being notably lower than during the COVID-19 years, the overall cost has risen substantially due to the elevated 
interest rates imposed on buyers. Typically, it takes a minimum of 10 years for a new buyer to fully pay off their mortgage. Our project 
aims to delve into the impact of these dynamics on individuals with varying family incomes. We find it intriguing to explore how the 
process of purchasing a home in today's market can be challenging, primarily due to affordability issues. The income of each individual 
plays a pivotal role in shaping the significance of embarking on the journey to buy a house. Achieving the ability to purchase a home and 
live comfortably is a formidable task. An essential question we seek to address is: What is the minimum income required for someone to afford a house?
Another aspect we wish to investigate is identifying the top 10 places in the USA where buying a house is the most expensive. Additionally, we aim to
compare the incomes of residents in the top 10 most expensive places with those in the top 10 least expensive places based on states. Upon completion of our
data analysis, we plan to present the information in a user-friendly format, featuring a drop-down menu that allows users to select any state in
the USA. On this page, users will find a graph displaying the average interest rates for housing on the right side. To enhance clarity, we will 
create a separate column dedicated solely to the state, especially considering that one database includes both addresses and states.
